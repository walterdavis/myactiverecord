h1. This is really old, and won't run on modern PHP

You should try this one: https://github.com/walterdavis/mini-active-record instead.

MyActiveRecord was created by Jake Grimley at MadeMedia Ltd. I have forked the project, with Jake's blessing, because he no longer has time to devote to upgrades and maintenance.

You may read more about MAR at its project page on "PHPClasses.org":http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/2990.html

h2. MyActiveRecord

A simple, speedy Object/Relational Mapper for MySQL based on Martin Fowler's ActiveRecord pattern and heavily influenced by the implementation of the same name in Ruby on Rails.

h3. Features

* Mapping of table to class and row to object
* Relationship retrieval
* Data validation and error handling
* PHP5 and PHP4 compatibility

h3. Limitations

This class acheives simplicty of use and implementation through the following 'by-design' limitations:

# This class talks to MySQL only.

# Table/Class mapping is achieved by each database table being named IDENTICALLY to the MyActiveRecord subclass that will represent it (but in lowercase for compatibility reasons).

# Every database table mapped by MyActiveRecord MUST have an auto-incrementing primary-key named @id@.

h3. Changelog 0.4 - 0.5

# BUG FIXES

## ::TimeStamp: fix syntax error.
## ::Update: fix syntax error.
## find_linked: fix SQL error.
## validate_uniqueness_of: fix edge case when object has not been saved, typo.

# ADDITIONS
## Added DEFAULT_LIMIT global variable to set max number of rows returned.
## Added validate_email and validate_unique_email functions.
## Added validate_existence function.
## Added count_children and count_linked functions.
## Added find_siblings function.
## Added ::DistinctValues and distinct_values functions.

h3. Changelog 0.3 - 0.4

# BUG FIXES
## Error is triggered when connection fails or database cannot be selected
## If Class cannot be found or table cannot be found to match class scriptreports error instead of hanging. (this fixes bug introduced in 0.3)
## Removal of error notices on save dues to presumption about existance of variables

# FIND_CHILDREN() IMPROVEMENTS  
Added new paramaters to the find_children() method. First the full complement of Where, OrderBy, Limit and Offset a-la FindAll(). Second, the addition of a ForeignKey parameter. Useful if you have a table with a two foreign keys pointing to the same table, and so you need to use a different name to parent_table_id

# ADDED FREQDIST() WHERE and LIMIT parameters  
e.g. @print_r( MyActiveRecord::FreqDist( 'Order', 'total_lines', "date BETWEEN '2005-01-01' AND '2006-01-01'" ) )@
